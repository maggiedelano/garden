HTML files to publish my digital garden at https://www.maggiedelano.com/garden. Based on the [Digital Garden Jekyll template](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) by Maxime Vaillancourt.

I am publishing the HTML files here because Github Pages does not play well with third party plugins.
